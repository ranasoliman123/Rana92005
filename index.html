  Water is life <span class="highlight">te wai ko te ora</span>. Here, you’ll discover how small actions can lead to big changes, all guided by the powerful Māori principle of
  <span class="highlight">Kaitiakitanga</span> the deep responsibility of guardianship and care for the natural world.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Welcome to our Water Conservation Site!</strong><br>
  Explore how you can make a difference by embracing the values of <em>Kaitiakitanga</em>. This Māori concept reminds us that we are caretakers of nature, not owners entrusted to protect water as a sacred taonga (treasure) for future generations.
  Through small, meaningful actions, you can become part of a movement that blends ancient wisdom with modern sustainability. Let’s honour our waters, restore our rivers, and make every drop count.
</p>

<p>
  Kaitiakitanga teaches us that we are not owners of the land and water, but <span class="highlight">stewards</span>, entrusted to protect these sacred resources for future generations.
  It’s about <span class="highlight">respect, balance, and connection</span>  with nature, with community, and with whakapapa (our lineage and future descendants).
</p>

<p>
  Water is one of our planet’s most precious resources, yet it’s often taken for granted. With climate change, growing populations, and pollution putting pressure on water supplies, it's more important than ever to use water wisely. This website is dedicated to raising awareness about water conservation and sharing simple ways we can all make a difference. Whether it’s fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, or changing daily habits, every action counts. Let’s work together to protect our water for future generations.
