  Water is life — <span class="highlight">te wai ko te ora</span>. Here, you’ll discover how small actions can lead to big changes, all guided by the powerful Māori principle of
  <span class="highlight">Kaitiakitanga</span> — the deep responsibility of guardianship and care for the natural world.

  <strong>Welcome to our Water Conservation Site!</strong><br>
  Explore how you can make a difference by embracing the values of <em>Kaitiakitanga</em>. This Māori concept reminds us that we are caretakers of nature, not owners — entrusted to protect water as a sacred taonga (treasure) for future generations.
  Through small, meaningful actions, you can become part of a movement that blends ancient wisdom with modern sustainability. Let’s honour our waters, restore our rivers, and make every drop count.
</p>

<p>
  Kaitiakitanga teaches us that we are not owners of the land and water, but <span class="highlight">stewards</span>, entrusted to protect these sacred resources for future generations.
  It’s about <span class="highlight">respect, balance, and connection</span> — with nature, with community, and with whakapapa (our lineage and future descendants).
